# An Unofficial Fast & Frugal Tool For Downloading All Documents from HelloSign
HelloSign does not have an option to export all documents from your account. This script goes through all your HelloSign documents and downloads them locally.

# Use Cases
* Moving off of HelloSign
* Archiving or Backup

# How to Setup
I don't want to link a guide that gets outdated so DYOR for getting set up.

I've included dependencies in the `vendor` directory for a more deterministic runtime experience. 

# How to Run
`ruby main.rb`
